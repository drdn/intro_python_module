# Introduction to Python

This repository contains assets for Introduction to Python Online Learning Module from the University of Maryland [Open Learning](https://umd-ul.catalog.instructure.com/courses/introduction-to-python) catalogue.

These materials are intended to be an interactive self-guided learning alternative to in-person workshops at the University of Maryland Libraries Research Commons. If you are interested in attending a Research Commons workshop in person, browse the calendar of events [here](https://www.lib.umd.edu/rc/data-science).

## Workshop Contents

* Jupyter Notebook 1 - Introduction to basic syntax and features
* Jupyter Notebook 2 - Working with data: Matplotlib, Pandas, and NumPy

## Prerequisites

* A personal or university Google account.
* An Internet connection.
* The Google Colaboratory add-on for Google Drive.

## How to use the materials

These materials were created for use in a UMD Open Learning course, but the course content is made available here for anyone to use.

The lesson materials may be downloaded and used with a local Jupyter Notebook or used online in Google Colaboratory.

### What is the Google Colaboratory?

Google recently introduced Colaboratory, a Google Drive connected application for running Jupyter Notebook documents in the cloud. After you download the workshops files, open them in Google Colaboratory:

* Right click on the file (.ipynb extension).
* Choose "Open with..."
* Select Colaboratory.

If you do not see Colaboratory as an option (common if you are using a personal Google account), you will need to add Colaboratory to your Google Drive:

* Right click on the file (.ipynb extension).
* Chose "Open with"
* Select "Connect more apps"
* Type "Colaboratory" in the search bar.
* Select "Colaboratory" and then install/add to Drive.
